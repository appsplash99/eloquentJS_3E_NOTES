CHAPTER 4 - Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

Data sets-
JavaScript provides a data type specifically 
or storing sequences of values. 
It is called an array and is written as a list of values 
between square brackets, separated by commas.
  let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
The first index of an array is zero, not one. 
So the first element is retrieved with listOfNumbers[0]. 


Properties-
Almost all JavaScript values have properties. 
The exceptions are null and undefined. 
If you try to access a property on one of these nonvalues, you get an error.
  null.length;
  // → TypeError: null has no properties

The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with
a dot and with square brackets. 
Both value.x and value[x] access a property on value—
but not necessarily the same property.

The difference is in how x is interpreted. 
When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. 
When using square brackets, 
the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name. 
Whereas value.x fetches the property of value named “x”, 
value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result, 
converted to a string, as the property name.

So if you know that the property you are interested in is called color,
you say value.color. 
If you want to extract the property named by the value held in the binding i, 
you say value[i]

Property names are strings. 
They can be any string, 
but the dot notation works only with names that look like valid binding names. 
So if you want to access a property named 2 or John Doe,
you must use square brackets: value[2] or value["John Doe"].


Methods-
Properties that contain functions 
are generally called methods of the value they belong to, 
as in “toUpperCase is a method of a string”.


Objects-
Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties. 
One way to create an object is by using braces as an expression.

Reading a property that doesn’t exist will give you the value undefined.

REMEMBER:
  To briefly return to our tentacle model of bindings—
  property bindings are similar. 
  They grasp values, 
  but other bindings and properties might be holding onto those same values. 
  You may think of objects as octopuses with any number of tentacles, 
  each of which has a name tattooed on it.

  The delete operator cuts off a tentacle from such an octopus. 
  It is a unary operator that, when applied to an object property, 
  will remove the named property from the object. 
  This is not a common thing to do, but it is possible.

  let anObject = {left: 1, right: 2};
  console.log(anObject.left);
  // → 1
  delete anObject.left;
  console.log(anObject.left);
  // → undefined
  console.log("left" in anObject);
  // → false
  console.log("right" in anObject);
  // → true

The binary in operator, 
when applied to a string and an object, 
tells you whether that object has a property with that name.
The difference between 
setting a property to undefined and actually deleting it is that, 
in the first case, the object still has the property 
(it just doesn’t have a very interesting value), whereas in the second case
the property is no longer present and in will return false.

To find out what properties an object has, you can use the Object.keys

There’s an Object.assign function 
that copies all properties from one object into another.
  let objectA = {a: 1, b: 2};
  Object.assign(objectA, {b: 3, c: 4});
  console.log(objectA);
  // → {a: 1, b: 3, c: 4}

REMEMBER:
  Arrays, then, are just a kind of object 
  specialized for storing sequences of things. 
  If you evaluate typeof [], it produces "object". 
  You can see them as long, 
  flat octopuses with all their tentacles in a neat row, labeled with numbers.


MUTABILITY-
numbers, strings, and Booleans, are all immutable.

When we have two numbers, 120 and 120, 
we can consider them precisely the same number, 
whether or not they refer to the same physical bits. 

With objects, 
there is a difference between having two references to the same object 
and having two different objects that contain the same properties. 
Consider the following code:
  let object1 = {value: 10};
  let object2 = object1;
  let object3 = {value: 10};

  console.log(object1 == object2);
  // → true
  console.log(object1 == object3);
  // → false

  object1.value = 15;
  console.log(object2.value);
  // → 15
  console.log(object3.value);
  // → 10
The object1 and object2 bindings grasp the same object, 
which is why changing object1 also changes the value of object2. 
They are said to have the same identity. 
The binding object3 points to a different object, 
which initially contains the same properties as object1 
but lives a separate life.

Bindings can also be changeable or constant, 
but this is separate from the way their values behave. 

Even though number values don’t change, 
you can use a 'let' binding to keep track of a changing number 
by changing the value the binding points at. 
Similarly, though a 'const' binding to an object can itself not be changed 
and will continue to point at the same object, 
the contents of that object might change.

When you compare objects with JavaScript’s == operator, 
it compares by identity: 
it will produce true only if both objects are precisely the same value.
Comparing different objects will return false, 
even if they have identical properties.


The lycanthrope's log:
  let journal = [];
  function addEntry(events, squirrel) {
    journal.push({events, squirrel});
  }
Note:
  The object added to the journal looks a little odd. 
  Instead of declaring properties like events: events, 
  it just gives a property name. 
  This is shorthand that means the same thing—
  if a property name in brace notation isn’t followed by a value, 
  its value is taken from the binding with the same name.

Arrays have an includes method that checks 
whether a given value exists in the array. 
The function uses that to determine whether 
the event name it is interested in is part of the event list for a given day.


Array loops:
  
  for (let i = 0; i < JOURNAL.length; i++) {
  let entry = JOURNAL[i];
  // Do something with entry
  }

When a for loop looks like this, with the word of after a variable definition, 
it will loop over the elements of the value given after of. 
This works not only for arrays but also for strings and 
some other data structures. We’ll discuss how it works in Chapter 6.


Further arrayology:

We saw push and pop, 
which add and remove elements at the end of an array,
earlier in this chapter. 
The corresponding methods for adding 
and removing things at the start of an array are called unshift and shift.
  let todoList = [];
  function remember(task) {
    todoList.push(task);
  }
  function getTask() {
    return todoList.shift();
  }
  function rememberUrgently(task) {
    todoList.unshift(task);
  }

To search for a specific value, arrays provide an indexOf method. 

Use:
Array.indexOf to find first instance in an array
Array.lastIndexOf to find last instance in an array
(if item not found returns: -1)
  console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 1].indexOf(2));
  // → 1
  console.log([1, 2, 3, 2, 1].lastIndexOf(2));
  // → 3

Array.slice:
  Another fundamental array method is slice, 
  which takes start and end indices and 
  returns an array that has only the elements between them. 
  The start index is inclusive, the end index exclusive.
    console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2, 4));
    // → [2, 3]
    console.log([0, 1, 2, 3, 4].slice(2));
    // → [2, 3, 4]

Array.concat:
  The concat method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array, 
  similar to what the + operator does for strings.
  function remove(array, index) {
    return array.slice(0, index)
      .concat(array.slice(index + 1));
  }
  console.log(remove(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], 2));
  // → ["a", "b", "d", "e"]

If you pass concat an argument that is not an array, 
that value will be added to the new array as if it were a one-element array.


Strings and their properties:
Values of type string, number, 
and Boolean are not objects, and 
though the language doesn’t complain if you try to set new properties on them,
it doesn’t actually store those properties. 
As mentioned earlier, such values are immutable and cannot be changed.

But these types do have built-in properties. 
Every string value has a number of methods.

  console.log("coconuts".slice(4, 7));
  // → nut
  console.log("coconut".indexOf("u"));
  // → 5

String.indexOf:
can search for more than one charaters
  console.log("one two three".indexOf("ee"));
  // → 11

String Trim:
The trim method removes whitespace 
(spaces, newlines, tabs, and similar characters) 
from the start and end of a string.
  console.log("  okay \n ".trim());
  // → okay

String.zeroPad:
  console.log(String(6).padStart(3, "0"));
  // → 006

String.split() and String.join():
  let sentence = "Secretarybirds specialize in stomping";
  let words = sentence.split(" ");
  console.log(words);
  // → ["Secretarybirds", "specializea", "in", "stomping"]
  console.log(words.join(". "));
  // → Secretarybirds. specialize. in. stomping

String.repeat():
  console.log("LA".repeat(3));
  // → LALALA

String.length:
  let string = "abc";
  console.log(string.length);
  // → 3
  console.log(string[1]);
  // → b


Rest parameters:
  function max(...numbers) {
    let result = -Infinity;
    for (let number of numbers) {
      if (number > result) result = number;
    }
    return result;
  }
  console.log(max(4, 1, 9, -2));
  // → 9
When such a function is called, 
the rest parameter is bound to an array containing all further arguments. 
If there are other parameters before it, 
their values aren’t part of that array. 
When, as in max, it is the only parameter, it will hold all arguments.

You can use a similar three-dot notation 
to call a function with an array of arguments.
  let numbers = [5, 1, 7];
  console.log(max(...numbers));
  // → 7

Square bracket array notation similarly allows the triple-dot operator:
to spread another array into the new array.
  let words = ["never", "fully"];
  console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);
  // → ["will", "never", "fully", "understand"]


The Math object:
The Math object is used as a container to 
group a bunch of related functionality. 
There is only one Math object, 
and it is almost never useful as a value. 
Rather, it provides a namespace so that all these functions and 
values do not have to be global bindings.

Having too many global bindings “pollutes” the namespace.

Trignometric functions:
  function randomPointOnCircle(radius) {
    let angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
    return {x: radius * Math.cos(angle),
            y: radius * Math.sin(angle)};
  }
  console.log(randomPointOnCircle(2));
  // → {x: 0.3667, y: 1.966}


Math.random:
This is a function that returns a new pseudorandom number:
between zero(inclusive) and one (exclusive) every time you call it.
  console.log(Math.random());
  // → 0.36993729369714856
  console.log(Math.random());
  // → 0.727367032552138
  console.log(Math.random());
  // → 0.40180766698904335

Math.floor: to get a whole number
  console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
  // → 2

Math.ceil: (for “ceiling”, which rounds up to a whole number),
Math.round: (to the nearest whole number),
Math.abs, which takes the absolute value of a number, 
meaning it negates negative values but leaves positive ones as they are.


DESTRUCTURING:

############# ASK IN VC ###############
A similar trick works for objects, using braces instead of square brackets.
  let {name} = {name: "Faraji", age: 23};
  console.log(name);
  // → Faraji
  console.log(age);
  // → 23
  console.log(name.age);
  // → undefined
  console.log(typeof {name})
  // → object
Note that if you try to destructure null or undefined, you get an error, 
much as you would if you directly try to access a property of those values.


JSON:
Because properties only grasp their value, rather than contain it, 
objects and arrays are stored in the computer’s memory,
as sequences of bits holding the addresses—the place in memory—
of their contents.

What we can do is serialize the data. 
That means it is converted into a flat description. 
A popular serialization format is called JSON (pronounced “Jason”), 
which stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON looks similar to JavaScript’s way of writing arrays and objects, 
with a few restrictions.:
1. All property names have to be surrounded by double quotes, 
2.  and only simple data expressions are allowed—
    no function calls, bindings, or anything that involves actual computation. 
3. Comments are not allowed in JSON.

A journal entry might look like this when represented as JSON data:
  {
    "squirrel": false,
    "events": ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running"]
  }

JSON.stringify: (given by JavaScript Language Itself)
  takes a JavaScript value and returns a JSON-encoded string. 

JSON.parse: (given by JavaScript Language Itself)
  takes such a string(returned by stringify)
  and converts it to the value it encodes.

  let stringJSON = JSON.stringify({
    squirrel: false,
    events: ["weekend"]
  });
  console.log(stringJSON);
  // → {"squirrel":false,"events":["weekend"]}
  console.log(JSON.parse(stringJSON).events);
  // → ["weekend"]



SUMMARY:

1.  Most values in JavaScript have properties, 
    the exceptions being null and undefined. 
2.  Properties are accessed using value.prop or value["prop"].
3.  You can iterate over arrays using a special kind of for loop—
    for (let element of array).


EXERCISES:
1.  The sum of a range:
    console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));

1.1 Write a range function that takes two arguments, 
    start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers 
    from start up to (and including) end.
/* CODE SOLUTION */
    // const range = (start, end) => {
    //   let arr = [];
    //   for (let i=start; i<=end; i++) {
    //     arr.push(i)
    //   }
    //   return arr;
    // }

1.2 Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and 
    returns the sum of these numbers. 
    Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.
/* CODE SOLUTION */
    // const sum = (arr) => {
    //   let total = 0;
    //   for (let element of arr) {total+=element}
    //   return total
    // }

1.3 Bonus Assignment: 
    modify your range function to take an optional third argument:
    that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. 
    If no step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, 
    corresponding to the old behavior. 
    The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. 
    Make sure it also works with negative step values:
    so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
/* CODE SOLUTION */
    // const range = (start, end, step=1) => {
    //   let arr = [];
    //   if (step>=0) {
    //     for (let i=start; i<=end;step) {
    //       arr.push(i)
    //       i+=step 
    //     }
    //   } else {
    //     for (let i=start; i>=end;step) {
    //       arr.push(i)
    //       i+=step 
    //     }
    //   }
    //   return arr;
    // }


2.Reversing an array:
  Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array, 
  by inverting the order in which its elements appear.
  For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. 

2.1 The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and 
    produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order.
/* CODE SOLUTION */
    // const reverseArray = (arr) => [...arr].reverse()


2.2 The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: 
    it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. 
    Neither may use the standard reverse method.
/* CODE SOLUTION */
    // const reverseArrayInPlace = (arr) => arr.reverse()

2.3 Thinking back to the notes:
    about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, 
    which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? 
    Which one runs faster?
/* SOLUTION */
    reverseArray -> is a pure function, 
      which returns a copy of array, for which it needs to store:
      another array data structure as copy.

    reverseArrayInPlace -> is not a pure function,
      beacuse it mutates the original array parameter.

    FASTER SOLUTION:
      reverseArrayInPlace is faster than reverseArray because of:
      not toring another datastructure.

    USE CASE:
      As reverseArray is a pure function, 
      its more useful in functional progreamming and
      cases where we must not mutate the parameter array.

      As reverseArrayInPlace is not a pure function,
      but returns a mutated reverse array efficiently,
      it can be used at places:
      where we have to reverse the initial array efficiently.

    SIDE EFFECTS:
      the above functions return the array along with a side effect.


3. A list
Objects, as generic blobs of values, 
can be used to build all sorts of data structures. 
A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with array).

A list is a nested set of objects, 
with the first object holding a reference to the second, 
the second to the third, and so on.
  let list = {
    value: 1,
    rest: {
      value: 2,
      rest: {
        value: 3,
        rest: null
      }
    }
  };

A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. 
For example, 
if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1, rest: list} 
(with list referring to the binding defined earlier),
they are both independent lists, 
but they share the structure that makes up their last three elements. 
The original list is also still a valid three-element list.

3.1 Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure 
    like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. 

3.2 Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. 

3.3 Then add a helper function prepend, 
    which takes an element and a list and 
    creates a new list that adds the element to 
    the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and 
    returns the element at the given position in the list 
    (with zero referring to the first element) or 
    undefined when there is no such element.
